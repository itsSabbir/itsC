- Type casting: Learn how to convert one data type into another.
- Type modifiers (short, long, unsigned): Modify data type sizes and ranges.
- Variables and constants: Declare variables and define constants for storing values.

## 2. Operators and Expressions
- Arithmetic operators: Perform mathematical calculations.
- Assignment operators: Assign values to variables.
- Bitwise operators: Manipulate data at the bit level.
- Operator precedence: Understand the order in which expressions are evaluated.
- Relational and logical operators: Compare values and build complex logical expressions.

## 3. Control Structures
- break and continue statements: Control the flow within loops.
- if-else statements: Make decisions based on conditions.
- Loops (for, while, do-while): Execute code repeatedly.
- switch-case statements: Choose actions based on variable values.

## 4. Functions
- Function declaration and definition: Learn how to declare and define reusable blocks of code.
- Function parameters and return values: Pass data to functions and get results.
- Function prototypes: Declare functions before using them in code.
- Recursion: Solve problems using functions that call themselves.

## 5. Arrays and Strings
- Character arrays and strings: Store and manipulate text data.
- Multidimensional arrays: Work with data organized in multiple dimensions.
- One-dimensional arrays: Store sequences of elements.
- String manipulation functions: Use standard library functions to handle strings.

## 6. Pointers
- Pointer arithmetic: Perform operations on memory addresses.
- Pointer declaration and initialization: Declare pointers and assign memory addresses.
- Pointers and arrays: Understand the relationship between pointers and array elements.
- Pointers to functions: Pass functions as arguments and return functions from other functions.

## 7. Memory Management
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free): Manage memory at runtime.
- Memory leaks and how to avoid them: Prevent wasted memory and improve efficiency.
- Stack vs Heap: Understand the differences between these two memory regions.

## 8. Structures and Unions
- Defining and using structures: Group related data together.
- Nested structures: Create complex data types with structures inside structures.
- Typedef: Create aliases for data types.
- Unions: Use memory efficiently by storing different data types in the same memory location.

## 9. File Handling
- Error handling in file operations: Manage file-related errors gracefully.
- File I/O operations: Read from and write to files.
- Text and binary file handling: Work with both text and binary data formats.

## 10. Preprocessor Directives
- #define and macros: Define constants and macros for code efficiency.
- #include: Include header files for code reuse.
- Conditional compilation (#ifdef, #ifndef, #endif): Control code compilation based on conditions.

## 11. Advanced Concepts
- Bit fields: Store data in a compact form at the bit level.
- Command-line arguments: Pass arguments to programs via the command line.
- Function pointers: Create and use pointers to functions for flexible code.
- Variadic functions: Create functions that accept variable numbers of arguments.

## 12. Standard Library
- math.h: Access mathematical functions.
- stdio.h: Perform standard input/output operations.
